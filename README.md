A web-based wallet made with PHP (Laravel), HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery for Motile (MIE) coin

Edit the .env file (that you will create; or make a copy of from .env.example) to add "XAPRPCIP", "XAPRPCPORT", "XAPRPCUSERNAME", and "XAPRPCPASSWORD" to whatever you have set for the wallet that you're connecting to. Then...#letHerRip!

Yes, I know I left the variables with "XAP" in them. This makes no difference for any wallet. Variable name choices are a moot point, although I do have to say hindsight is 20/20...

No DB necessary (unless you're doing some shady stuff...ahem).

If there are ANY security concerns please don't hesitate to mention them to me. I'd like to make this as secure as possible.

Additionally if there are any bug requests those are just as welcome (I may just not get around to them nearly as quickly, just being honest; I have a 9-5 too!)
